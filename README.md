# FinalProject
Point of Sale System done in java

Final project (Name to be determined) by Anthony Mouawad AKA ChiefAM

## Its my first program!!
This is my first program that I have ever made and I am very proud of it. I have been working on it for a few months now and I am very happy with the progress I have made. I have learned a lot about Java and programming in general. I have also learned a lot about the software development process and how to manage a project. I am very excited to continue working on this project and to see where it goes. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed making it.
